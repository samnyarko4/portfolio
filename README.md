Some challenges I had to face while creating my portfolio was implementing the darkmode. The dark mode was challenging because it was diffucult getting all the elements on the webpage to switch colors to make it mor visible for the user. Another challenge I faced was getting different view points to look exactly like the mock up. This was because i have two different monitors one being 4k and the other one not, whenever I looked at the wbpage on the non 4k screen it would look different and I found that confusing. What I learned while creating my portfolio was that it is easier to have all of your html already done then work form mobile to desktop is what I found to be the best workflow for me. I also learned that it is important to take breaks when you run into a problem to allow your brain to refresh and youll most likely come back with a resolution.  I hope to better this portfolio and use it when applying for positions.
